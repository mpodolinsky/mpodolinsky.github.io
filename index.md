Hi, Iâ€™m **Michal**!

I am a graduate student in the **Aerospace Engineering (MSc)** Controls, Autonomy, and Robotics track at *UT Austin* 

I work as a researcher in **robotics and autonomy** at the *Autonomous Systems Group*

Check out my [Projects](/projects/) or learn more [About Me](/about/).

*A cool commercial project I worked on consisted of using a front-facing LiDAR to estimate the altitude of a UAV*

## Michal P. Podolinsky
I was born in Slovakia and raised in Brussels, Belgium.

I completed my BSc in Aerospace Engineering at *Delft University of Technology* (TU Delft) in the Netherlands.

I pursued a minor in Technology Entrepreneurship at the *University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign* (UIUC).

I am currently pursuing an MSc in Aerospace Engineering in the Controls, Autonomy & Robotics track at the *University of Texas at Austin*.

My research at the *Autonomous Systems Group* has strengthened my passion for robotics and autonomy, and I hope to contribute to the advancement of safe, efficient, and generalizable robotics to improve the world around me.

In my free time, I enjoy hiking, running, and playing tennis. I am also a long-term active member and volunteer at YMCA scout summer camps.
